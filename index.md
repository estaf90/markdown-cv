## Presentation
Engineer with a strong mathematical background and a passion for data engineering/science projects with a special interest in cloud development and DevOps/MLOps.

## Work Experience

`09/22-now`
__Technical consultant @ CEVT__

Working as a Data Engineer in a cross functional team following the agile ways of working. I took part in discussions regarding services and frameworks to be used in our backend, most of which functionality was written in Go and some in Python. Implemented some functionality to handle http requests, connecting to a CloudSQL database and return some query results. Learned about migrations to control the evolution of a database. I also studied Terraform and investigated how we could benefit from using IaC.

__Technical consultant @ CEVT__

Took part in multiple projects over the course of a few years:

Worked as a project lead/developer in an innovation project to investigate the feasibility to detect abnormal communication on a CAN-bus using edge machine learning. The PoC was performed in collaboration with an external company, using their edge machine learning SDK.

Wrote an ETL application in Python, to run on a RaspberryPi, enabling an innovation project PoC. The application was extracting data from multiple sources (CAN, GPS, IMU and Camera), transforming the data into a common format and loading it to a cloud bucket for further processing and calculations.

Worked in an innovation project building a MLOps pipeline for an object recognition model. In the project a lot of different tools and services in Google Cloud was being used to solve: data versioning, model training/deployment/versioning/serving, data labelling and exposing an api.

__Technical consultant @ Combine__

Pre-study projects for smaller companies, e.g. Lithium-Ion battery lifetime prediction for AiTree, data analysis for customer transactions and developing a dashboard for Nimpos transaction systems. Node development and testing machine learning library in Sympathy for Data, which code base is written in Python.

`09/16-12/17`
__Technical consultant @ Volvo Cars__

Continued working on the probabilistic model developed during the master thesis project. Extended the algorithm to handle both multivariate and mixed-variate data simultaneously. A trained mode featured the possibilities to marginal and conditional probabilities. Developed an object oriented Python based analysis framework.
