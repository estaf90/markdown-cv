## Presentation
Data Scientist/Engineer with a strong mathematical background and a passion for data engineering/science projects with a special interest in Cloud Development and DevOps/MLOps.

## Work Experience

`12/22 - now`
__Emil Staf AB__: *Cloud Developer @ Sightic Analytics*

Working as a Cloud Developer in a cross functional team. My main responsibility was to help Sightic develop their new backend, using a server-less architecture in AWS. The backend stack consisted of API GW, Lambda, DynamoDB databases, S3 storage, SageMaker (ML inference endpoints), Certificates, etc.

After the first major version of the backend was released, I moved on to develop a dashboard (written in Python using Dash) to view and analyze inference and customer feedback.

Competenses: AWS, Serverless Application Model (SAM), DynamoDB, SageMaker

__Emil Staf AB__: *Data Engineer @ CEVT*

Working as a Data Engineer in a cross functional team following the agile ways of working. I took part in technical discussions and implementation regarding services and frameworks (including data pipelines for automating ETL) to be used in our backend, most of which functionality was written in Go and Python. I created database table relations by modeling data using ERD. Implemented CI pipeline for automatic testing in GitLab. Implemented functionality to handle http requests (APIGateway), connecting to a CloudSQL database (PostgreSQL) and return query results in response. Learned about migrations to control the evolution of a database. I also studied Terraform, investigated how we could benefit from using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to simplify our DevOps work by programmatically being able to proision the physical resources we needed for our application to run in cloud.

__Combine AB__: *Data Engineer @ CEVT*

Worked in an innovation project building a MLOps pipeline for object recognition. We developed cloud solutions for data versioning, model training/deployment/versioning/serving, data labelling and exposing an api. A lot of different services in Google Cloud was used, e.g. Kubeflow, TorchServe, AirFlow, etc. I took the major responsibility for the model versioning (SQL database) and the development of our API (FastAPI).

Wrote an application in Python, to run on a RaspberryPi, enabling an innovation project PoC. The application was extracting data from multiple sources (CAN, GPS, IMU and Camera), transforming the data into a common format and loading it to a cloud bucket (data lake) for further processing and calculations. In cloud a data pipeline for (ETL) would trigger on a successful file upload to validate and move data to BigQuery for future analysis.

<!-- Worked as a project lead/developer in an innovation project to investigate the feasibility to detect abnormal communication on a CAN-bus using edge machine learning. A collaboration project with an external company, using their edge machine learning SDK. -->


`01/19-09/19`
__Combine AB__: *In-house projects*

Pre-study projects for smaller companies, e.g. Lithium-Ion battery lifetime prediction for AiTree, data analysis for customer transactions and developing a dashboard to visualize data for Nimpos transaction systems. Node development and testing machine learning library in Sympathy for Data, which code base is written in Python.

`09/16-12/17`
__Combine AB__: *ML Engineer @ Volvo Cars*

Continued working on the probabilistic model developed during the master thesis project. Extended the algorithm to handle both multivariate and mixed-variate data simultaneously. A trained mode featured the possibilities to marginal and conditional probabilities. Developed an object oriented Python based analysis framework.
